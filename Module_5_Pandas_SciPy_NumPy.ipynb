    "Tabular data is quite common in genomic analyses.  You can imagine wanting to create and manipulate a table like the following:\n",

    "| Gene | expression in condition 1 | expression in condition 2 | log2 fold change | pvalue |\n",
    "|------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|--------|\n",

    "\n",

    "Ending up with a table like this often involves **merging** smaller tables together, **selecting** different columns of data from a data frame, **filtering** for rows that match specific conditions, manipulating the **shape** of the table between long and wide formats, and finally, plotting outputs.\n",
